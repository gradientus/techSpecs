              Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, and
              object-oriented high-level programming language, extended from
              Pascal and other languages. It has built-in language support for
              design by contract (DbC), extremely strong typing, explicit
              concurrency, tasks, synchronous message passing, protected
              objects, and non-determinism. Ada improves code safety and
              maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of
              runtime errors. Ada is an international technical standard,
              jointly defined by the International Organization for
              Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical
              Commission (IEC). As of 2020, the standard, called Ada 2012
              informally, is ISO/IEC 8652:2012.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ada was originally designed by a team led by French computer
              scientist Jean Ichbiah of CII Honeywell Bull under contract to the
              United States Department of Defense (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 to
              supersede over 450 programming languages used by the DoD at that
              time. Ada was named after Ada Lovelace (1815â€“1852), who has been
              credited as the first computer programmer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ada is used to design extremely large software systems. It is
              often used in US government agencies that depend on no errors in
              the code. It is currently used in the US Department of Defense,
              NATO, Airplan Info Management Systems, as well as many railway
              systems.

          <p class="description">
            BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family
            of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design
            philosophy emphasizes ease of use. The original version was designed
            by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth
            College in 1964. They wanted to enable students in fields other than
            science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all
            use of computers required writing custom software, which was
            something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn. In
            addition to the language itself, Kemeny and Kurtz developed the
            Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), which allowed multiple users
            to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time. This general model
            became very popular on minicomputer systems like the PDP-11 and Data
            General Nova in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hewlett-Packard
            produced an entire computer line for this method of operation,
            introducing the HP2000 series in the late 1960s and continuing sales
            into the 1980s. Many early video games trace their history to one of
            these versions of BASIC. The emergence of early microcomputers in
            the mid-1970s led to the development of number of BASIC dialects,
            including Microsoft BASIC in 1975. Due to the tiny main memory
            available on these machines, often 4 kB, a variety of Tiny BASIC
            dialects was also created. BASIC was available for almost any system
            of the era, and naturally became the de facto programming language
            for the home computer systems that emerged in the late 1970s. These
            machines almost always had a BASIC interpreter installed by default,
            often in the machine's firmware or sometimes on a ROM cartridge.
            BASIC fell from use during the later 1980s as newer machines with
            far greater capabilities came to market and other programming
            languages (such as Pascal and C) became tenable. In 1991, Microsoft
            released Visual Basic, combining a greatly updated version of BASIC
            with a visual forms builder. This reignited use of the language and
            "VB" remains a major programming language in the form of VB.NET.
          </p>
          <p>
            BASIC has no real modern uses other than historic and academic. Many
            other BASIC dialects have also sprung up since 1990, including the
            open source QB64 and FreeBASIC, inspired by QBasic, and the Visual
            Basic-styled RapidQ, Basic For Qt and Gambas. Modern commercial
            incarnations include PureBasic, PowerBASIC, Xojo, Monkey X and True
            BASIC (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company
            controlled by Kurtz). Several web-based simple BASIC interpreters
            also now exist, including Quite BASIC and Microsoft's Small Basic.
            Many versions of BASIC are also now available for smartphones and
            tablets via the Apple App Store, or Google Play store for Android.
            On game consoles, an application for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo
            DSi called Petit Computer allows for programming in a slightly
            modified version of BASIC with DS button support.

            <p>
              Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language,
              designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small, efficient language intended
              to encourage good programming practices using structured
              programming and data structuring. It is named in honour of the
              French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on Wirth's book, Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs,
              Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language.
              Wirth was involved in the process to improve the language as part
              of the ALGOL X efforts and proposed a version known as ALGOL W.
              This was not accepted, and the ALGOL X process bogged down. In
              1968, Wirth decided to abandon the ALGOL X process and further
              improve ALGOL W, releasing this as Pascal in 1970.
            </p>
            <p>
              On top of ALGOL's scalars and arrays, Pascal enabled defining
              complex datatypes and building dynamic and recursive data
              structures such as lists, trees and graphs. Pascal has strong
              typing on all objects, which means that one type of data cannot be
              converted or interpreted as another without explicit conversions.
              Unlike most languages in the C-family, Pascal allows nested
              procedure definitions to any level of depth, and also allows most
              kinds of definitions and declarations inside subroutines
              (procedures and functions). A program is thus syntactically
              similar to a single procedure or function. Pascal became very
              successful in the 1970s, notably on the burgeoning minicomputer
              market. Compilers were also available for many microcomputers as
              the field emerged in the late 1970s. It was widely used as a
              teaching language in university-level programming courses in the
              1980s, and also used in production settings for writing commercial
              software during the same period. It was displaced by the C
              programming language during the late 1980s and early 1990s as
              UNIX-based systems became popular, and especially with the release
              of C++.
            </p>
            <p>
              A derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented
              programming was developed in 1985; this was used by Apple Computer
              and Borland in the late 1980s and later developed into Delphi on
              the Microsoft Windows platform. Extensions to the Pascal concepts
              led to the languages Modula-2 and Oberon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today Pascal is primarily used to academic purposes, however, a
              derivative language called Object Pascal continues to be used by
              Microsoft today for some Windows applications.

              Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
              language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
              Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
              notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
              object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
              logical code for small and large-scale projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports
              multiple programming paradigms, including structured
              (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional
              programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included"
              language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python was
              conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language.
              Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list
              comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of
              collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a
              major revision of the language that is not completely
              backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run
              unmodified on Python 3.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first
              planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7
              release and therefore the last Python 2 release." No more security
              patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python
              2's end-of-life, only Python 3.5.x and later are supported.
            </p>

            <p>
              Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A
              global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an
              open source[34] reference implementation. A non-profit
              organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs
              resources for Python and CPython development.

          <div class="description">
            <p>
              x86 Assembly Language is a family of backward-compatible assembly
              languages, which provide some level of compatibility all the way
              back to the Intel 8008 introduced in April 1972. x86 assembly
              languages are used to produce object code for the x86 class of
              processors. Like all assembly languages, it uses short mnemonics
              to represent the fundamental instructions that the CPU in a
              computer can understand and follow. Compilers sometimes produce
              assembly code as an intermediate step when translating a high
              level program into machine code. Regarded as a programming
              language, assembly coding is machine-specific and low level.
              Assembly languages are more typically used for detailed and time
              critical applications such as small real-time embedded systems or
              operating system kernels and device drivers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each x86 assembly instruction is represented by a mnemonic which,
              often combined with one or more operands, translates to one or
              more bytes called an opcode; the NOP instruction translates to
              0x90, for instance and the HLT instruction translates to 0xF4.
              There are potential opcodes with no documented mnemonic which
              different processors may interpret differently, making a program
              using them behave inconsistently or even generate an exception on
              some processors. These opcodes often turn up in code writing
              competitions as a way to make the code smaller, faster, more
              elegant or just show off the author's prowess.
